Node.js V8 native fs.promises. Written in TypeScript, sans every sync method. *Async is the future!*

Docs
------

**Warning:** This library no longer re-exports fs.promises! Be sure you are ready to update to v0.5.0.

**Update:** v0.5.0 is a trial release for v1.0.0. If nothing is found wrong in this version, it will be re-released as v1.0.0 :tada:.

All `fs-nextra` methods return a promise exclusively. Requires minimum __Node.js v12.12.0__.

The full documentation can be found here: [fs-nextra.js.org](https://fs-nextra.js.org/).

`fs-nextra` is heavily based on `fs-extra`, this module wouldn't be possible without it's author:
